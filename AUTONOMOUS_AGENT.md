# Autonomous Agent Documentation

This document outlines the capabilities and usage of the fully autonomous AI agent implemented in this project. The agent has full access to the codebase and can execute complex tasks based on natural language instructions.

## Features

- **Full Read/Write/Edit Access**: The agent can read, edit, create, and delete any file in the project.
- **Natural Language Task Processing**: Submit tasks in plain English and the agent will figure out what needs to be done.
- **Automatic File Selection**: The agent can identify which files are most relevant to a given task.
- **Multi-Step Task Execution**: The agent breaks down complex tasks into individual steps and executes them in sequence.
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: The agent can make decisions about what code changes are needed without asking for permission.
- **Task History and Tracking**: All actions taken by the agent are recorded and can be reviewed.

## API Endpoints

The autonomous agent is accessible through the following API endpoints:

### 1. Execute Autonomous Task

```
POST /api/agent/api/autonomous-task
```

This endpoint takes a natural language task description and executes it fully autonomously.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "task": "Implement better error handling in the file service"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "taskId": "task_1623456789_abc123",
  "message": "Task executed successfully",
  "results": [
    {
      "action": "analyze",
      "relevantFiles": [
        {"path": "server/agent/file-service.ts", "relevance": 95}
      ]
    },
    {
      "action": "modify",
      "file": "server/agent/file-service.ts",
      "success": true,
      "message": "Successfully modified server/agent/file-service.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Analyze Code

```
POST /api/agent/api/analyze-code
```

This endpoint analyzes a specific file or finds relevant files automatically for a given task.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "task": "Check for security vulnerabilities",
  "filePath": "server/routes/auth-routes.ts"
}
```

If `filePath` is omitted, the agent will find the most relevant files automatically.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "analysis": "Detailed analysis of the code...",
  "filePath": "server/routes/auth-routes.ts"
}
```

### 3. Find Relevant Files

```
POST /api/agent/api/find-relevant-files
```

This endpoint finds the most relevant files for a given task.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "task": "Optimize database queries"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [
    {"path": "server/db/queries.ts", "relevance": 95},
    {"path": "server/models/user.ts", "relevance": 85},
    {"path": "server/routes/api.ts", "relevance": 75}
  ]
}
```

### 4. Modify File

```
POST /api/agent/api/modify-file
```

This endpoint modifies a specific file based on a natural language task.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "path": "server/routes/api.ts",
  "task": "Add rate limiting to all API endpoints"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Successfully modified server/routes/api.ts"
  }
}
```

### 5. Create File

```
POST /api/agent/api/create-file
```

This endpoint creates a new file based on a natural language task.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "path": "server/utils/rate-limiter.ts",
  "task": "Create a utility for rate limiting API requests"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Successfully created server/utils/rate-limiter.ts"
  }
}
```

### 6. Get Task History

```
GET /api/agent/api/task-history
```

This endpoint retrieves the execution history for all tasks or a specific task.

**Query Parameters:**
- `taskId` (optional): ID of the specific task to retrieve

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "taskId": "task_1623456789_abc123",
      "task": "Implement better error handling in the file service",
      "timestamp": "2025-04-10T15:30:45.123Z",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "server/agent/file-service.ts",
          "action": "modify",
          "status": "success"
        }
      ],
      "status": "completed",
      "result": "Task execution complete..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## JavaScript/TypeScript Client

The project includes a TypeScript client for easy integration with frontend code:

```typescript
import { autonomousAgent } from './src/autonomous-agent-client';

// Execute a complex task
const result = await autonomousAgent.executeTask(
  "Add input validation to all form submissions"
);

// Analyze code for a specific file
const analysis = await autonomousAgent.analyzeCode(
  "Check for security vulnerabilities", 
  "server/routes/auth-routes.ts"
);

// Find relevant files for a task
const relevantFiles = await autonomousAgent.findRelevantFiles(
  "Optimize database queries"
);

// Modify a file based on a task
const modifyResult = await autonomousAgent.modifyFile(
  "server/routes/api.ts",
  "Add rate limiting to all API endpoints"
);

// Create a new file
const createResult = await autonomousAgent.createFile(
  "server/utils/validator.ts",
  "Create a utility for validating user input"
);

// Get task execution history
const history = await autonomousAgent.getTaskHistory();
```

## Node.js Example

There's also a Node.js example script that demonstrates how to use the autonomous agent API:

```
node agent-autonomous-example.js
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: When providing tasks, be as specific as possible about what you want to accomplish.

2. **Complex Tasks**: For complex tasks affecting multiple files, use the `autonomous-task` endpoint instead of modifying individual files.

3. **Review Changes**: Always review the changes made by the agent to ensure they meet your requirements.

4. **Task Coordination**: Avoid submitting multiple overlapping tasks simultaneously to prevent conflicts.

5. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simpler tasks and gradually increase complexity as you become familiar with the agent's capabilities.

## Security Considerations

The autonomous agent has full access to modify any file in the project. Use it in a controlled environment and review all changes before deploying to production.

---

With this autonomous agent implementation, you now have a powerful tool that can execute complex development tasks without requiring manual intervention. The agent will find the relevant files, make appropriate changes, and report back on its actions - all based on natural language instructions.
