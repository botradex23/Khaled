3. **API Connection Management**: Enhance WebSocket connections with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
4. **Code Quality**: Establish and enforce a consistent code quality standard across the project
5. **Security Review**: Conduct a thorough security review focusing on credential handling and API security

## Process Completion

The agent has successfully completed all planned steps:

1. ✅ Recursively list all files in the project
2. ✅ Scan all relevant text/code files for Binance or API usage
3. ✅ Identify any bugs, connection issues, or misconfigurations
4. ✅ Fix identified issues where possible
5. ✅ Write summary to agent-log.txt

This report serves as a comprehensive analysis of the codebase's API usage patterns
and potential issues. The fixes applied represent a first step toward improving code
quality, but additional work is recommended as outlined in the Recommendations section.
