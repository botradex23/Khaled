‏Hi, I’ve identified the root cause of the OpenAI Agent issue in our project, and I’d like you to apply a complete and structured fix step by step only as described below. Please do not change anything beyond what is listed.

‏Objective:

‏Ensure that the OpenAI API key is properly loaded and used by the backend when requests come from the UI, so the agent functions normally without showing API key errors.

‏Steps to apply:

‏1. Load the .env configuration file properly
‏	•	In the main server file (server.ts, index.ts or equivalent), add at the top:

‏require('dotenv').config();



‏2. Ensure the OpenAI API key is accessed using the correct variable name
‏	•	Wherever the OpenAI API is initialized, make sure it uses:

‏const configuration = new Configuration({
‏  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});


‏	•	And verify that .env file contains:

‏OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx



‏3. All API calls to OpenAI must be done from the backend only
‏	•	The frontend must never access OpenAI directly.
‏	•	Verify that all requests go through backend routes (e.g., /api/agent/chat), and only the server performs requests to OpenAI using the API key.

‏4. Update frontend API call paths if needed
‏	•	In files like admin-my-agent.tsx, check and fix any direct calls to OpenAI.
‏	•	All fetch requests should look like:

‏fetch("/api/agent/chat", {
‏  method: "POST",
‏  body: JSON.stringify({ message }),
  ...
});



‏5. Configure CORS (if backend and frontend run on different origins)
‏	•	On the Express server, make sure to allow cross-origin requests:

‏app.use(cors({
‏  origin: '*', // or set the exact frontend URL
}));



‏6. Improve backend error messages
‏	•	If an error occurs (e.g., invalid key), return a clear message to the frontend that distinguishes between:
‏	•	Missing/invalid API key
‏	•	Quota exceeded
‏	•	Network error
‏	•	OpenAI model not available, etc.

‏Please go through these steps exactly, and do not change or restructure anything else in the codebase. Let me know once all steps are done.
