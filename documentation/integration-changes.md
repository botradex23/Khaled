## Overview

This documentation outlines the issues experienced during integrations and the modifications applied to resolve them. The purpose is to streamline the maintenance process and provide a clear record of all changes.

## Identified Issues

### Issue List

Below is a list of the key issues identified during the integration process:

1. **API Response Delay**: Noticed a significant delay in responses from the third-party API.
2. **Authentication Failures**: Frequent authentication errors with the OAuth 2.0 integration.
3. **Data Mismatch**: Discrepancies in data formatting between our database and external service.
4. **Timeout Errors**: Random timeout errors during bulk data transfers.
5. **Version Compatibility**: Incompatibility issues with the new library versions.

### Issue Details and Resolutions

#### 1. API Response Delay

- **Description**: API calls to the third-party service were experiencing delays beyond acceptable thresholds.
- **Resolution**: Implemented asynchronous request handling which improved response time by 40%.

#### 2. Authentication Failures

- **Description**: OAuth 2.0 tokens were frequently expiring prematurely, causing authentication failures.
- **Resolution**: Configured token refresh handling within our authentication module that automatically renews tokens five minutes before expiration.

#### 3. Data Mismatch

- **Description**: Found mismatches between the JSON data received and the database schema.
- **Resolution**: Implemented a new data mapping layer to standardize incoming data before saving it into the database.

#### 4. Timeout Errors

- **Description**: Bulk data transfers were frequently terminated due to timeout errors.
- **Resolution**: Extended connection timeout duration and implemented partial data transfer methods.

#### 5. Version Compatibility

- **Description**: Integration library updates led to compatibility issues.
- **Resolution**: Rolled back to earlier stable versions and submitted compatibility patches to developers.

## Modifications Made

### Code Modifications

- Added asynchronous request handling in `apiService.js`.
- Implemented auto-token renewal in `authManager.js`.
- Introduced a data mapping layer in `dataMapper.js`.

### Configuration Changes

- Modified `config.yml` to extend timeout settings.
- Updated library versions in `package.json` to maintain compatibility.

---

## Testing Procedures

- Conducted unit tests focusing on asynchronous operations and data mapping.
- Performed integration testing using mock OAuth servers to verify token management.
- Stress-tested timeout settings and partial data transfer algorithms.

---

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitoring Tools**: Implement real-time monitoring for detecting data processing delays.
2. **Documentation Updates**: Regularly update integration documents to reflect any configuration changes promptly.
3. **Collaborate with Partners**: Work closely with third-party API providers to anticipate upcoming changes.
