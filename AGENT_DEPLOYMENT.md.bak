# OpenAI Agent Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy and manage the enhanced OpenAI Agent system with autonomous capabilities in both development and production environments.

## Deployment Options

The agent server can be deployed in several ways:

### 1. Enhanced Autonomous Agent (Recommended)

The enhanced agent with full autonomous capabilities can be deployed using the provided shell scripts:

```bash
# Start the enhanced agent server with autonomous capabilities
./start-enhanced-agent.sh

# Stop the enhanced agent server
./stop-enhanced-agent.sh
```

This deployment option provides the agent with comprehensive file system access, intelligent code modification capabilities, and autonomous problem-solving features.

### 2. Standard Standalone Server

Run the agent on a dedicated server/process without the enhanced capabilities:

```bash
# Start the server in the background
node start-agent-server.js

# Stop the server
node stop-agent-server.js
```

### 2. Integrated with Main Application

The agent can be integrated directly into the main Express application by importing the agent functionality:

```javascript
// In your main server.js or app.js
import { setupAgentRoutes } from './server/agent-routes.js';

// After setting up your Express app
setupAgentRoutes(app);
```

## Environment Variables

The agent requires the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
- `AGENT_PORT` - Port to run the agent server on (default: 5002)

## Security Configuration

In production environments, implement the following security measures:

1. **Authentication**: Replace the simple X-Test-Admin header with proper JWT authentication
2. **HTTPS**: Configure SSL/TLS for all agent API endpoints
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **IP Restrictions**: Consider restricting access to specific IP addresses
5. **Audit Logging**: Enable detailed logging of all agent operations

## Scaling Considerations

For high-traffic environments, consider the following:

1. **Multiple Instances**: Run multiple agent servers behind a load balancer
2. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequent file operations
3. **Queue System**: Use a queue system for long-running agent tasks
4. **Worker Pool**: Implement a worker pool for parallel file operations

## Monitoring

Monitor the agent server health and performance:

1. **Health Checks**: Use the `/health` endpoint for regular health checks
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and resource usage
3. **Error Logging**: Set up proper error logging and alerting
4. **Disk Usage**: Monitor disk usage for file operations

## Backup and Recovery

Implement a backup strategy for agent-generated content:

1. **Automated Backups**: Schedule regular backups of agent outputs
2. **Version Control**: Use Git or another VCS for important files
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Document procedures for reverting agent changes

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Server Won't Start**: Check the PORT is not in use and environment variables are set
2. **Authentication Errors**: Verify the admin token is correctly configured
3. **File Permission Issues**: Ensure the server has proper permissions
4. **OpenAI API Errors**: Check API key validity and usage limits

## Proxy Considerations

When deploying behind a proxy:

1. **Header Forwarding**: Ensure authentication headers are properly forwarded
2. **Timeout Configuration**: Adjust timeouts for long-running operations
3. **WebSocket Support**: If using WebSockets, ensure proxy supports them

## Integration with CI/CD

Add the agent deployment to your CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Automated Testing**: Run the agent tests before deployment
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Automate agent server updates
3. **Rollback Triggers**: Set up automatic rollback on error thresholds

## Updating the Agent

When updating the agent system:

1. Stop the current agent server
2. Update the code and dependencies
3. Run tests to verify functionality
4. Start the new agent server
5. Verify all endpoints are working

## Documentation

Keep the following documentation updated:

1. **API Reference**: Document all agent endpoints and parameters
2. **Example Scripts**: Provide examples for common operations
3. **User Guides**: Create guides for different user roles
4. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Document common issues and solutions
