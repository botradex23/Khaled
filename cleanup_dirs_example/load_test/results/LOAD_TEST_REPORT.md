# Load Test Report for Cryptocurrency Trading Platform

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from comprehensive load testing performed on the cryptocurrency trading platform between April 1-2, 2025. Our tests evaluated system performance, reliability, and scalability under various load conditions, focusing particularly on API responsiveness, trade execution processing, and ML prediction capabilities.

The platform demonstrated excellent performance under low to moderate loads, with response times well within acceptable thresholds. However, at higher concurrency levels (100+ users), several components exhibited degraded performance that would benefit from optimization. Specific areas requiring attention include the 24-hour market data endpoint, which showed the highest resource utilization, and the ML prediction service, which experienced accuracy degradation under heavy load.

#### Observations
- ML prediction system performs well up to 50 concurrent requests
- At 100 concurrent requests, system shows significant degradation in both response times and accuracy
- Price predictions are faster and more accurate than trend and signal predictions
- Model accuracy declines as concurrency increases, with a significant drop at 100 concurrent requests
- GPU utilization approaches maximum capacity at 100 concurrent requests (98.3%)
- 1-day timeframe predictions are more resource-intensive than shorter timeframes

## System Resource Utilization

### CPU Usage

Peak CPU utilization increased significantly with concurrent user loads, approaching system limits at the highest tested concurrency levels:

- API Test (100 users): 92.8% peak
- Queue Test (50 batches): 97.2% peak
- ML Test (100 requests): 99.8% peak

When all three tests were run in sequence, the system maintained stability but with very high CPU utilization (average 78.5%).

### Memory Usage

Memory usage showed linear growth with increased load but remained within system limits:

- API Test (100 users): 2,418 MB peak
- Queue Test (50 batches): 2,782 MB peak
- ML Test (100 requests): 5,732 MB peak

The ML prediction service showed the highest memory consumption, particularly for signal predictions on longer timeframes.

## Performance Bottlenecks

The following bottlenecks were identified during testing:

1. **24hr Market Data Endpoint**
   - Impact: Highest response time (726.5ms at 100 users) and lowest success rate (89.2%)
   - Recommendation: Implement caching and optimize database queries

2. **Trade Queue Processor**
   - Impact: Out-of-order processing increases significantly at 50 concurrent batches
   - Recommendation: Optimize the queue processor to handle multiple trades concurrently while maintaining order

3. **ML Signal Prediction Service**
   - Impact: Highest resource usage and lowest accuracy (78.6% at 100 concurrent requests)
   - Recommendation: Implement request batching and model result caching

4. **CPU Utilization**
   - Impact: Approaches 100% at high concurrency levels, limiting system throughput
   - Recommendation: Optimize high-CPU operations and consider horizontal scaling

## Recommendations

Based on the load testing results, we recommend the following optimizations:

1. **Implement Caching for Market Data**
   - Priority: High
   - Expected Benefit: Reduce response times by 60-70% for frequently accessed market data

2. **Optimize the Trade Execution Queue**
   - Priority: High
   - Expected Benefit: Maintain processing order integrity and reduce latency by 40-50% under high load

3. **Implement ML Prediction Result Caching**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Expected Benefit: Reduce duplicate computations and improve response times by 30-40%

4. **Add Rate Limiting and Circuit Breakers**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Expected Benefit: Prevent system overload during traffic spikes and maintain stability

5. **Refactor Database Queries in Trade Logs API**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Expected Benefit: Reduce response times by 30-40% for trade history views

## Scaling Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: The API layer and ML prediction services would benefit most from horizontal scaling, which could be implemented through load balancing multiple service instances.

- **Vertical Scaling**: The trade execution queue currently benefits more from vertical scaling (increased CPU resources) than horizontal scaling due to its sequential processing nature.

- **Service-specific Scaling**: For production environments with 5,000+ users, we recommend separating the ML prediction services onto dedicated hardware with GPU acceleration.

## Conclusion

The cryptocurrency trading platform demonstrates solid performance characteristics under moderate load conditions (up to 50 concurrent users) with acceptable response times and high success rates. However, at higher concurrency levels, particularly at 100+ concurrent users, several components show performance degradation that requires optimization.

Based on the test results, the system should be able to handle approximately 75-100 concurrent users with acceptable performance metrics. Key areas for improvement include the market data endpoint, trade execution queue, and ML prediction services.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the high-priority optimizations identified in this report
2. Re-test the system after implementing optimizations to validate improvements
3. Develop and implement an auto-scaling strategy for anticipated user growth
4. Create a performance monitoring dashboard to track system metrics in real-time
