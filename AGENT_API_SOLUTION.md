# Agent API Solution: Bypassing Vite Middleware

## Problem Overview

The Tradeliy platform was experiencing issues with the `/api/my-agent/*` endpoints returning HTML instead of JSON responses. This caused problems when attempting to read files or access the agent services programmatically. After investigation, we identified that the Vite development middleware was intercepting API requests and returning its own HTML responses instead of allowing the Express routes to handle the requests properly.

## Solution Architecture

We implemented a dual-approach solution to ensure robust API access:

### 1. Direct Agent Client (Primary Solution)

The most effective solution was creating a direct client library that bypasses HTTP entirely:

- **File**: `src/agent-client.ts`
- **Type**: TypeScript class with direct filesystem and OpenAI API access
- **Benefits**: No middleware interference, direct access to the filesystem, no network issues

This approach allows for:
- Reading files directly from the filesystem
- Writing files directly to the filesystem
- Listing directory contents
- Making OpenAI API requests directly

### 2. Standalone API Server (Alternative Solution)

We also created a standalone Express server that runs independently:

- **File**: `standalone-api-server.mjs`
- **Port**: 3099
- **Benefits**: Separate from Vite middleware, dedicated to API operations

This server provides:
- File read operations
- Directory listing
- Status endpoints
- All responses in proper JSON format

## Implementation Details

### Direct Agent Client

The `AgentApiClient` class in `src/agent-client.ts` provides:

```typescript
// Create a client with your OpenAI API key
const client = new AgentApiClient(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY);

// Read a file
const fileResult = await client.readFile('path/to/file.txt');
if (fileResult.success) {
  console.log(fileResult.content);
}

// Write a file
await client.writeFile('output.txt', 'File content here');

// List files in a directory
const dirResult = await client.listFiles('src');
if (dirResult.success) {
  console.log(dirResult.files);
}

// Get a completion from OpenAI
const completionResult = await client.getChatCompletion('Your prompt here');
if (completionResult.success) {
  console.log(completionResult.completion);
}
```

### Standalone API Server

The server can be started using:

```bash
./start-agent-server.sh
```

This starts an Express server on port 3099 with the following endpoints:

- `GET /status` - Check server status
- `GET /read-file?path=<filepath>` - Read a file (requires X-Test-Admin header)
- `GET /list-files?directory=<dirpath>` - List files in a directory (requires X-Test-Admin header)

## Testing and Validation

We validated the solution with comprehensive tests:

1. Direct file operations test (`src/run-agent-example.ts`):
   - Successfully read `src/README.md`
   - Successfully wrote to `test-output.txt`
   - Successfully made OpenAI API request

2. Standalone API Server test:
   - Server starts successfully on port 3099
   - Status endpoint returns proper JSON
   - Authentication with X-Test-Admin header works

## Integration with Existing Code

The solution integrates with the existing codebase in the following ways:

1. Direct client can be imported and used in any TypeScript file:
   ```typescript
   import { AgentApiClient } from './src/agent-client';
   ```

2. Standalone server can be started as a separate process:
   ```bash
   ./start-agent-server.sh
   ```

3. Both solutions use the same environment variables as the main application.

## Security Considerations

1. The direct client uses the filesystem directly, so it inherits the security context of the Node.js process.
2. The standalone server implements authentication via the `X-Test-Admin` header.
3. Both solutions validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks.

## Conclusion

This two-pronged approach provides a robust solution to the Vite middleware interference issue:

1. **For Direct Code Integration**: Use the `AgentApiClient` class to directly interact with files and OpenAI, avoiding HTTP entirely.
2. **For External API Access**: Use the standalone API server on port 3099 to get clean JSON responses.

This solution maintains all functionality of the original API while bypassing the middleware issues completely.
