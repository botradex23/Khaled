# Tradeliy Agent API 

## Overview

This directory contains the refactored agent code with a new direct file operation API client. This implementation provides a solution to bypass the Vite middleware that was causing API endpoints to return HTML instead of JSON.

## Key Components

### Agent Client (`agent-client.ts`)

The `AgentApiClient` class provides direct file system operations and OpenAI API access without going through Express or Vite middleware:

- **Direct file operations**: Read, write, and list files directly
- **OpenAI integration**: Make OpenAI API calls directly with the API key
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all operations
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed responses with proper interfaces

### Example Usage (`agent-client-example.ts`)

This file demonstrates how to use the agent client with examples for:

1. Reading files
2. Listing directory contents
3. Writing files
4. Getting chat completions from OpenAI

## Problem Solved

The original implementation suffered from the following issues:

1. **Vite Middleware Interference**: API endpoints that were supposed to return JSON were returning HTML
2. **Express Router Limitations**: Routes in server/routes were being intercepted by Vite
3. **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: CORS issues when trying to access the API from different origins

## Solution Approach

Our solution takes three different approaches:

### 1. Direct Client Library

The `AgentApiClient` class in `agent-client.ts` provides direct access to:
- File system operations
- OpenAI API

This bypasses all middleware and routing issues by operating directly on the file system and making external API requests.

### 2. Standalone API Server

The `standalone-api-server.mjs` file creates a completely independent Express server that:
- Runs on a different port (3099)
- Has its own routing and middleware
- Is not affected by Vite middleware
- Provides pure JSON responses

### 3. Route Modification

The updated routes in `server/routes/my-agent.ts` include:
- Explicit Content-Type headers
- Modified routing to avoid Vite interference
- Direct file operation endpoints

## Usage Examples

### Using the Agent Client

```typescript
import { AgentApiClient } from './agent-client';

// Create client with API key
const client = new AgentApiClient(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY);

// Read a file
const result = await client.readFile('path/to/file.txt');
if (result.success) {
  console.log(result.content);
}

// List files in directory
const files = await client.listFiles('src');
if (files.success) {
  console.log(files.files);
}

// Get OpenAI completion
const completion = await client.getChatCompletion('Hello, AI!');
if (completion.success) {
  console.log(completion.completion);
}
```

### Using the Standalone API Server

Start the server:
```bash
node standalone-api-server.mjs
```

Make requests:
```bash
# Get status
curl http://localhost:3099/status

# Read a file (with authentication header)
curl -H "X-Test-Admin: true" http://localhost:3099/read-file?path=README.md

# List files in a directory
curl -H "X-Test-Admin: true" http://localhost:3099/list-files?directory=src
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add more file operations (delete, move, etc.)
2. Add authentication to the direct client
3. Expand OpenAI capabilities with streaming responses
4. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
